The purpose of this project is to make SIMON GAME. I was provided with the UI, the buttons, colors and sounds. 
I wrote the logic behind the game. The starting of game, search for wrong press at each turn and finally leveling up.

Search for SIMON GAME on the internet. You'd know how to play it. 

Will write comments to each line in few weeks.
